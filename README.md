Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.


```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPAlert", .upToNextMajor(from: "4.2.0"))
]
```

## Quick Start

For start need import `NativeRefresh`

```swift
            RefreshableScrollView {
                YourContent()
            }
            .onRefresh {
                try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 2_000_000_000)
            }

```

## Aviable API

Base Api for refresh action:

```swift
            RefreshableScrollView {}
                .onRefresh {
                    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 2_000_000_000)
                }
```
